    <h1>Tangy Potato Salad Recipe</h1>
    <h2>By Binging with Babish</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather ingredients: 4 cups red and gold baby potatoes, halved, Water, 1 head of cabbage, ½ red onion, chopped, 2-3 Tbsp sour cream, 3 Tbsp freshly chopped dill, 1-2 Tbsp white wine vinegar, Kosher salt, Freshly ground pepper, Scallions, sliced, Chives, finely chopped, 1½ Tbsp olive oil, 1 Tbsp whole grain mustard</li>
      <li>Boil your baby potatoes until they are toothsome (10-15 minutes). Let cool.</li>
      <li>As the potatoes cool, combine the following in a bowl: ½ of one red onion (chopped), 2-3 Tbsp of sour cream, 3 Tbsp of freshly chopped dill, 1-2 Tbsp of white wine vinegar, a few pinches of kosher salt, some freshly ground pepper, some thinly sliced scallions, some finely chopped chives, 1½ Tbsp olive oil, and 1 large Tbsp of whole grain mustard.</li>
      <li>Add the boiled and cooled potatoes to the mixture. Add additional salt and pepper to taste.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>I can strongly recommend this potato salad over the bog standard, average joe, potato salad.<p>
    <p>It brings a nice, almost tangy flavor to an otherwise bland vegetable.<p>
